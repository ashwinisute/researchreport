Market Definition

Bio-based polymers are materials containing at least a fraction of the polymer made from renewable basic ingredients. Bio-based polymers, for example, can be made from corn or sugarcane. The remaining polymers might be made from carbon derived from fossil fuels. They are manufactured from sustainable resources. Biodegradable polymers are products whose physical and chemical qualities deteriorate when exposed to microorganisms, methane, carbon dioxide, and water processes. Bio-based polymers can be biodegradable (such as polylactic acid) or non-biodegradable (for example, biopolyhethylene).
