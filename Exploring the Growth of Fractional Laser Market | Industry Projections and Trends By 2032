What is the projected market size & growth rate of the Fractional Laser Market?

Analysis and Size

Increased adoption of non-invasive aesthetic procedures will propel the fractional laser market in the forecast period of 2023-2030. A device that delivers a laser beam split into thousands of minuscule treatment zones that only focus on a portion of the skin at a time similar to how a photographic image is improved or changed pixel by pixel is used in the non-invasive fractional laser treatment procedure. Fractional laser therapy has bridged the gap between ablative and non-ablative laser treatments for sun-damaged and ageing skin. While ablative laser treatments focus primarily on the epidermis (surface skin cells) and non-ablative treatments focus solely on dermal collagen (the skin's mid-layer), fractional laser treatments target both the epidermal and dermal layers.

Data Bridge Market Research analyses that the fractional laser market which is USD 1.50 billion in 2022, is expected to reach USD 3.0 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 9.00% during the forecast period 2023 to 2030.
