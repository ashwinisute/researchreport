Market Analysis and Size

Lumber pallets are easily available and unlike heavy cartons, the workers can use forklifts, pallet jacks, conveyors, or other handling equipment to easily move and place the pallets in the position. By using pallets, different goods and packs can be combined, which saves a lot of space and hassle to track multiple boxes or pallets. As wooden pallets can be reused, they provide a lower cost per trip and lesser environmental impacts than pallets, which can be used only once and are subjected to the cost of reverse logistics.

Data Bridge Market Research analyses that the global lumber pallet market which was USD 8.44 billion in 2022, is expected to reach USD 13.86 billion by 2030, and is expected to undergo a CAGR of 6.1% during the forecast period of 2023 to 2030. “Food and beverages” dominates the end-user segment of the global lumber pallet market due to the need for safe and sanitary transportation and storage of their products.
