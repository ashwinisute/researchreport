What is the projected market size & growth rate of the Vitreoretinal Surgery Devices Market?

Vitreoretinal diseases are conditions that affect structures in the eye called the retina and the vitreous. The retina is the light-sensitive layer in the back of the eye that focuses images and transmits that information to the brain via the optic nerve. The vitreous is a clear gel that fills the space between the lens (in the front of the eye) and the retina. The global vitreoretinal surgery devices market is experiencing significant growth, fueled by the escalating incidence of retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). With the World Health Organization reporting that at least 2.2 billion people worldwide suffer from near or distance vision impairment, the demand for advanced vitreoretinal surgical solutions is more pressing than ever. This surge in market expansion is driven by aging population and increasing diabetes rates, which are contributing to higher prevalence of these debilitating retinal conditions. As a result, innovations in surgical technology and imaging systems are pivotal in addressing this global vision health crisis, providing new opportunities for market development and improved patient outcomes.
